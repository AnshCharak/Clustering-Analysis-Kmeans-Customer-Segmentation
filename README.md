# Clustering-Analysis-Kmeans-Customer-Segmentation


The goal of this project is to:
  
1) Perform an exploratory analysis on the dataset.
2) Check that the assumptions K-means makes are fulfilled.
3) Apply K-means clustering algorithm in order to segment customers.

## Data Set Information

The csv file corresponding used herein was downloaded from [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/akram24/mall-customers).
The dataset contains data about customers from a Mall. The information gather is: `Customer ID`, `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, `Spending Score (1-100)`.

## Analysis

This repository contains two files:

- `clustering_analysis.ipybn`: In this jupyter notebook, exploratory data analysis is performed. Moreover, the algorithm assumptions are checked. K-means is applied to segment customers obtaining a graph and the customer segments. It is also shown how to predict to which segment a new customers belongs to. 
- `customers.csv` dataset used to perform the analysis.

The whole analysis was done using JupyterLab and Python, using libraries such as: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
