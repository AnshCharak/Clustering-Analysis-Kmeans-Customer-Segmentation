## Using clustering algorithm to segment customers, K-means


The goal of this project is to:
  
1) Perform an exploratory analysis on the dataset.
2) Check that the assumptions K-means makes are fulfilled.
3) Apply K-means clustering algorithm in order to segment customers.


The csv file corresponding used herein was downloaded from [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/akram24/mall-customers).

The whole analysis was done using JupyterLab and Python, using libraries such as: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
